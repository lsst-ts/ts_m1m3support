/**
 * Performs bump test on single force actuator (FA). Bump tests of an actuator
 * is performed by applying a small positive and negative force offsets on
 * stationary (parked) mirror. The tests is evaluated by comparing value
 * reported by the force actuator load cell with the target (offset) value.
 *
 * Settings stored under ForceActuatorSettings/BumpTest specify timeouts,
 * allowable ranges and number of measurements performed. The configuration
 * values are enclosed in the following text with : - for example
 * :TestedTolerances/Warning:
 *
 * Bump test is performed in the following stages (per actuator axis, so if both
 * primary and secondary shall be tested, this is repeated twice per dual axis
 * actuator):
 *
 * 1. check that average of :TestMeasurements: measured forces roughly equal to
 * 0 (within :TestedTolerances/Error: for the FA being tested, and within
 * :NonTestedTolerances/Error: for FAs not tested)
 *
 * 2. apply a small positive force (222 N, _testForce member variable)
 *
 * 3. sleep for :SettleTime: seconds
 *
 * 4. check that the average of :TestMeasurements: force actuator values
 * following the settle time equals (within :TestedTolerances/Error: for tested
 * FA and :NonTestedTolerances/Error: for not tested FAs) equals to the applied
 * (target offset) force
 *
 * 5. null applied offset
 *
 * 6. sleep for :SettleTime: seconds
 *
 * 7. check that the average of :TestMeasurements: force actuator values
 * following the settle time equals (within :TestedTolerances/Error: for tested
 * FA and :NonTestedTolerances/Error: for not tested FAs) equals to the 0
 *
 * 8. apply a small negative force (-222 N, - _testForce member variable)
 *
 * 9. sleep for :SettleTime: seconds
 *
 * 10. check that the average of :TestMeasurements: force actuator values
 * following the settle time equals (within :TestedTolerances/Error: for tested
 * FA and :NonTestedTolerances/Error: for not tested FAs) equals to the 0
 *
 * 11. null applied offset
 *
 * 12. sleep for :SettleTime: seconds
 *
 * 13. check that the average of :TestMeasurements: force actuator values
 * following the settle time equals (within :TestedTolerances/Error: for tested
 * FA and :NonTestedTolerances/Error: for not tested FAs) equals to the 0
 *
 * If any of the steps fails, transition to failed stage, reset to zero all
 * applied offsets and exit the bump test for the given FA.
 *
 * :TestedTolerances/Warning: and :NonTestedTolerances/Warning: are used as
 * warning levels. If the error surpassed those, but doesn't trigger an error
 * (is not above error value), a warning message is send to the system log.
